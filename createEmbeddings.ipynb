Recent advancements in LED quality and brightness levels surpasses past iterations and as of May 2008 this seems to be the best light in this size and form factor.  The Stylus Pro is an improvement over the thinner but not-as-bright regular Stylus, also a great little light (and reviewed also in the video).  The SP not only has a brighter \"high flux\" LED but its push button switch makes it one hand operable, a big advantage pretty much in all situations.  For these features it is only slightly thicker than the regular Stylus but still very lightweight (only a svelte 1.8 oz).  The output is also electronically controlled meaning its brightness will be more consistent and even through the life of the batteries.  Other features including materials, battery types, and their clips are covered in the video.  Both the Stylus and the Stylus Pro are super quality lights that feature lightweight, small size, and good durability.  In the world of small lights the Stylus Pro is currently reigning supreme.'\n",
